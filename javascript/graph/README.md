# Graphs 

*A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.*

---

## Challenge 

*Implementing a Graph represented as an adjacency list.*

---

## Approach & Efficiency
 
- AddNode()
- AddEdge()
- GetNodes()
- GetNeighbors()
- Size()


*Big O :*

-  time : O(1)
- Space : O(n+m)

# THE END
