# Hash Table

Hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values

## Challenge

Create a hash table that can store an objects depends on its key.

## Approach & Efficiency

**The big O:**

- space: O(1)
- time: O(1)

---

## API 

- `add(key , value)` which inserts value into the hash table.

- `contains(key`) which check if the key exists in the hash table.

- `get(key)` which return a value of that key.

- `hash(key)` which return an index in the collection.
