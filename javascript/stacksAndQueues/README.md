# Stacks and Queues

Need to create a node , stack and queue constructor class along with some methods

---

## Challenge

Create a stack class that has methods to push, pop, peek and isEmpty methods  .
Create a Queue class that has methods to enqueue, dequeue, peek and isEmpty methods  .

---

## Approach & Efficiency

The Big O 

- space: O(1)
- time: O(1)

---

## API

4 methods for Stack --->

- push function --> which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack.

- pop function -->  that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value.

- peek function --> that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.

- isEmpty function -->  that takes no argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

4 methods for Queue --->

- enqueue -->  which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue

- dequeue --> that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value

- peek --> that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the queue, without removing it from the queue.

- isEmpty function -->  that takes no argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty.
