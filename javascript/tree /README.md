# Trees

Trees represents the nodes connected by edges

---

## Challenge

Create 3 Classes for Node , BinaryTree and BinarySearchTree with some methods 
we have the root , left , right Node and each method did a different thing to implement this tree 

---

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O :

**BinaryTree :**

- Space : O(h)
- Time : O(n)

**BinarySearchTree :**

- Space : O(h)
- Time : O(n)

---

## API

**BinaryTree :**

- Add Three Methods preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.


**BinarySearchTree :**

- Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree

- Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
