3 Methods 
1- Insert Function --> which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list .

2- Includes Function -->  which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

3- ToString Function --> which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
