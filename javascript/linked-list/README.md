7 Methods --->

1- Insert Function --> which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list .

2- Includes Function -->  which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.

3- ToString Function --> which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

4- append --> which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

5 - insertBefore --> which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node

6- insertAfter --> which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

7- kthFromEnd --> which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node’s value that is k from the end of the linked list.
